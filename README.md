# Intuit Intermediate Apollo

## Getting started

Open up a terminal window/command prompt/Powershell prompt in `intuit-apollo` and run   

```shell
npm install
npm run graphql-server
```

That should install dependencies and start a GraphQL server on port 8000.

Then open another prompt and run  

```shell
npm run dev
``` 

That should run a client server (React on top of Vite), usually on port 5173.
